# Happy

This project is part of the [Next Level Week 3] course (https://rocketseat.com.br/) and consists of a website where we can search for orphanages that may receive some visits. Users can register orphanages as well. We will have a map where it will be possible to see the registered orphanages.

We mainly use [React](https://reactjs.org), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org). 

This is under construction because the course in not over.

Thanks to [Diego Fernantes](https://github.com/diego3g) from [RocketSeat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).
